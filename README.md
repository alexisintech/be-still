<!-- TEA SPILL -->

## üåù Tea Spill
Created this cute little project because I love how on pinterest, there are movie stills with poetic captions on them, and the captions aren't always quotes from the movies. I wanted an app where users can create these on their own: users can go through movie stills until they find the one they like, and then add whatever caption that they want - it even could be something silly and they could make memes. I tried playing with htmltopng and domtopng but I couldn't get it working. I also tried using useEffect() to add a fade-in/fade-out class so that when the user clicks on the "Generate new image" button, the images have a cool transition. I think I could use a library like animate.css for this transition, but I moved on to larger projects. I plan to revisit this as a fun side project.
